# Hero Defense

Android-only single-hero action-defense game made with Java and libGDX.

## Modules

- `core`: platform-independent gameplay, simulation, persistence models, and tests.
- `android`: the only launcher, packaging target, and instrumentation-test target.

There are intentionally no desktop, iOS, or browser modules. Input is touch-only.

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for tracked scope and progress.

## Build cache policy

Use `./scripts/gradle.sh <task>` for all local/CI Gradle invocations. The script keeps the wrapper distribution, dependency cache, and project cache under `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` rather than in the repository. GitHub Actions sets the same locations explicitly.
